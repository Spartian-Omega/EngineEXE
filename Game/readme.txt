TBD if required.

Currently I am trying to utilise WinRT and DirectX (Direct2D specifically) to create some arbitrary 2D game.

Language being utilised is C++.

Currently referencing this for WinRT and Direct2D: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/composition/composition-native-interop
Specifically this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/composition/composition-native-interop#cwinrt-usage-example

Beware most of the Direct2D examples do not utilise WinRT, Direct2D resource: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-portal
UWP Resource: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/
WinRT Resource: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/

Interesting Article Covering the SpriteVisual Class, has a DirectX example but is in C#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Composition.SpriteVisual?view=winrt-19041
